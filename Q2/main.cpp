Assignment 4 - Question 2

This function uses the board's built-in timer to measure the amount of time
a user pressed a button. The timer starts upon a button press, and is stopped
upon a button release. The measured time is then printed into through the
board's Serial port.

Developed using the Mbed IDE. Tested on an EA LPC4088 QuickStart Board. */
