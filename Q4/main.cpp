Assignment 4 - Question 4

This function uses the PWM interface to control the duty cycle and period of
LED1. The duty cycle defines how much, in percentage, of a period does a 
does the board send a logical HIGH signal to the LED. Given that LED1 is
Active Low, that would translate into how much of a time period would the LED
be off.

A short button press would result in a slight increase to the duty cycle,
while a press that is longer than 3 seconds would result in an increase in
the period. When the maximum duty cycle value is reached (1.0f or 100%), the
next short press would result in its reset to 0.0f. This same approach is taken
for the time period, as the limit of 5 seconds is reached, it would be reset to
one second on a long press.

Developed using the Mbed IDE. Tested on an EA LPC4088 QuickStart Board. */
