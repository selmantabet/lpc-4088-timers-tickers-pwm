\section*{Overview}

This assignment required the usage of an EA LPC4088 QuickStart Board mounted on a base board through an FFC cable (basically a ribbon cable, but smaller). Before the board was connected to the computer through a USB 2.0 Micro cable. The online Mbed IDE was used to compile the C code and the output binary files were then copied into the device's flash storage through USB, and leveraging the built-in HDK USB drag-n-drop programming feature to automatically flash the binary file into the board's memory.

This assignment focuses on the usage of the board's timers (including the SysTick interface), tickers and the Pulse-width Modulation (PWM) interface. They are used to schedule tasks in a well-defined manner with respect to time. Timers can be used to count the time elapsed since a certain event with high precision. Tickers are used to define repeated triggers. Finally, PWM is a modulation that can take two parameters, namely the duty cycle and period, to carry out tasks that make use of the modulation scheme, such as motors and LEDs.

Since I have been explicitly prompted to stick to singular short paragraphs to explain my work, many inherent and potentially important nuances will be left out of the discussion and only brief abstractions of the programs' workings would be explained.\pagebreak

\section*{Question 1}
\begin{minted}{cpp}
/* Selman Tabet (@selmantabet - https://selman.io/) - UIN 724009859
Assignment 4 - Question 1

This function leverages the board's SysTick timer to turn LEDs between two
states, one where LEDs 2, 3 and 4 turn on for two seconds, the other state 
turns LED1 and would switch on and off every half a second, for a period of two
seconds. Which means that LED1 would be blinking twice through that period.
The board's clock rate is 120MHz, and since the reload register is 24 bits wide
the maximum value that can be used is around 16.7 million. Thus, the value of
15 million cycles was used for the SysTick implementation here. Being set at 
8th of a second, this reload value would result in eight ticks per second.

This function makes use of the board's built-in timer to measure the amount of time a user pressed a button. Two ISRs were defined; one that would be triggered when the button is pressed so it starts counting, and the other is triggered when the button is released so that the timer is stopped and measured. The measured time is then printed through the board's Serial port. Figure \ref{fig:q2} includes a screenshot of the terminal's output on multiple button presses.

This function uses the board's ticker interface to switch LEDs every second. Only one LED would be on at any given time. The LEDs are turned on then off in the following sequence: \texttt{LED1 -> LED2 -> LED3 -> LED4}.
This sequence is done three times in a cyclic manner, then the sequence is reversed for another three times, and then back to normal for another three, and so on. To achieve this behavior, three variables were defined; 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{iterator} : Counts how many turns out of three were taken so far.
  \item \texttt{state\_id} : Keeps track of which LED is ON, i.e. the current state.
  \item \texttt{invert\_flag} : Defines the direction at which the sequence is being executed.

/* Selman Tabet (@selmantabet - https://selman.io/) - UIN 724009859
Assignment 4 - Question 4

This function uses the PWM interface to control the duty cycle and period of
LED1. The duty cycle defines how much, in percentage, of a period does a 
does the board send a logical HIGH signal to the LED. Given that LED1 is
Active Low, that would translate into how much of a time period would the LED
be off.

A short button press would result in a slight increase to the duty cycle,
while a press that is longer than 3 seconds would result in an increase in
the period. When the maximum duty cycle value is reached (1.0f or 100%), the
next short press would result in its reset to 0.0f. This same approach is taken
for the time period, as the limit of 5 seconds is reached, it would be reset to
one second on a long press.
